# V-Lab

- Run `npm install` after cloning the repository to install dependencies.

- Run `ng serve --open` to start a development server
  and open `http://localhost:4200/` in the default browser.
  The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

- Run `ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /vlab/`
  to build the project and put the output in the docs folder.
  The `--base-href` flag makes the links work for the deployed environment.
  Make a copy of `docs/index.html` at `docs/404.html`
  and commit changes and push to the master branch to publish the changes.
